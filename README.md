# SNES9x running on Chicory

A port of https://github.com/kazuki-4ys/snes9x2005-wasm/ to [Chicory](https://github.com/dylibso/chicory).

You need to download a rom *THAT YOU LEGALLY OWN*. Change the path to the smc rom file in App.java. Run:

```
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.dylibso.snes.App"
